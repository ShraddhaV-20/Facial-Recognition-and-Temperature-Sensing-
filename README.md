# Facial-Recognition-and-Temperature-Sensing-

A small effort put by the team to comabt the Covid-19 pandemic situation. It has been rightly said, “crisis gives birth to the changes which were pending for many years”, and this is evident through the prevailing circumstances. Things have changed to meet the needs of the society and people are getting adjusted to the new normal of their lives.
An online survey on Covid-19 was conducted to obtain a better insight into the actual trobles and areas of concern of the people. The responses from this form has helped us better understand the issue that they have been facing and thereby help them meet their requirement.

## Problem Statement 
To design a contactless system to facially recognise residents before entering the residential premises and to check the temperature prior to letting them in. 

## Methodology 
Agile Methodology was followed throughout the project.

Multi-face detection ---> Processing --> Database of the face --> Trained features --> Converted to greyscale --> Classification of the face (Known and Unknown) --> Contactless Temperature sensing --> Arduino Processing --> LCD Display --> Buzzer Alert System 

## 3D Modelling

## Result 
The mini project course was executed and completed using the agile methodology. Software tools for the saem were made use of effectively. To sum it up, as per customer need, a system was designed which recognises people entering the apartments, scans the temperature and only then allows the visitors into the premises. Requirements of the customer were considered and given utmost importance. Thus, the prototype meets all the demands and a few of the wished features of the customer.
